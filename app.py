        Here is the process:
        1.  First, you MUST get the user's destination, start date, and end date. If any are missing, ask for them.
        2.  Once you have the core details, confirm them with the user.
        3.  Then, ask the user what they want to plan next: flights, hotels, or activities.
        4.  Use the appropriate tool to find options for them.
        5.  Present the options to the user. Allow them to confirm a choice.
        6.  Once the user is happy with all the parts of their trip, they will ask for the final itinerary.
        7.  Use the `write_itinerary` tool ONLY when the user asks for the final summary. You will need to pass the complete trip state to it.
